2: Difference between a library and framework?
   ANS: 
        Library: -Provides reusable function for our code  
                 -Our code controls when and where to call the library
                 -Library can be added to augment the features of an existing application 
                 -helps us to reuse the software function
                 -Intent of la library is to provide reusable software functionality

        Framework: -Provides ready to use tools, standards, templates, and policies for fast application development  
                   -The framework controls call of libraries for our code 
                   -To leverage the benefit of framework, a fresh application can be developed following the framework's guideline
                   -Helps us to develop software application quickly
                   -Intent of framework is to reduce the complexity of the software development process  

3: What is CDN? Why do we use it?
   ANS:
       -A Content Delivery Network(CDN) is a distributed group of servers that caches content close to end user
       -A CDN allows us to quick transfer of asset needed for loading internet content, including HTML pages, JS files,stylesheets, images and videos

   ANS:
       -In development mode, we can enable and utilize React developer tools, devtools profiler, debugging environment attached with source code. We can utilize various functionalities such as Hot Module Replacement, diagnostics so that development environment will help to debug code.
       -In production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.
       -react.development.js : More developer friendly, readable, will take more size.
       -react.production.js : Minified code that is not developer friendly as it focused on decreasing in file size, code efficiency.    
8: .What are async and defer?
   ANS:
       -Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page.
